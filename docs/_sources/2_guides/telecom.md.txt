# Modeling Telecom

Telecommunications play a key role in any tele-operated system, and the availability and bandwidth of the communication
link limits the performance of the system.

The bandwidth of a communication link is determined by the properties of the transmitter and receiver, as well as the
distance between them and any obstructions or media in the communication path.

The availability of a communication link depends on whether there is an occultation of some body between the transmitter
and receiver, whether the transmitter or receiver is able to be pointed towards the other, and whether the transmitter
or receiver has been allocated for a different purpose and is busy.
