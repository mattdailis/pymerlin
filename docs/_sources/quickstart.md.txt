# Quickstart

This section describes how to get started with `pymerlin` ðŸŽ‰

## Installation

First, make sure you have Java 21 JRE and python 12 installed on your machine.

- Java: https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/
- Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3120/

Once those are ready, make a [python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for your project

After activating that environment, install `pymerlin` with the following command:

```shell
pip install pymerlin
```
